# iOS Keyboard Fix

This plugin provides code to fix a problem with the cut, paste, etc buttons. on the iPhone 6 Plus causing a crash. There is no plugin as such, just some iOS Objective C that provides extra categories on the NSObject and UIView class to prevent the crash. The code for these categories was found at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33807812/uiwebview-uithreadsafenode-responderforediting-crash.
